**(https://fifthcirclestudios.com/netherform-public-license)**  

## Acceptance

In order to obtain any license under these terms, you must agree to them as strict obligations and conditions to all your licenses. By using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, or selling copies of the software, you agree to these terms.

## Copyright License

The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor's copyright in it for any permitted purpose. However, you may only distribute the software according to the [Distribution License](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works based on the software according to the [Changes and New Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license).

## Distribution License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to distribute copies of the software. Your license to distribute covers distributing the software with changes and new works permitted by the [Changes and New Works License](#changes-and-new-works-license). Distribution is allowed only under the following conditions:

- **Redistribution of Source Code**: Redistribution of the source code, whether modified or unmodified, that includes proprietary code written by Fifth Circle Studios is allowed under the MIT License, provided you adhere to the terms of the MIT License.
- **Redistribution of Prebuilt Binaries**: Redistribution of prebuilt binaries (executable or compiled versions) that include proprietary code written by Fifth Circle Studios requires payment of a licensing fee. You must contact Fifth Circle Studios to inquire about applicable fees for redistribution or for permission to redistribute prebuilt binaries containing proprietary code.

## Notices

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the URL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines beginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided with the software. For example:

> Required Notice: Copyright © Fifth Circle Studios.  
> Redistribution restrictions apply to proprietary code written by Fifth Circle Studios. Contact Fifth Circle Studios for redistribution licensing of prebuilt binaries.

## Changes and New Works License

The licensor grants you an additional copyright license to make changes and new works based on the software for any permitted purpose, subject to the following:

- You may create modifications or new works based on the proprietary code written by Fifth Circle Studios. However, if you plan to redistribute the modified code as **prebuilt binaries**, you must either:
  1. Remove or replace the proprietary code with stock Godot code or code you have written yourself, or
  2. Pay the licensing fee for redistribution of prebuilt binaries containing proprietary code.

## Patent License

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software that covers patent claims the licensor can license or becomes able to license, that you would infringe by using the software. This license does not extend to proprietary code written by Fifth Circle Studios, which may be subject to separate patent claims and restrictions.

## Noncompete

Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing to others any product that competes with the software. A **competing product or service** refers to any product or service that replicates, substitutes, or closely resembles the software's core functionality or value. You may not use the proprietary code to create a competing product or service.

## Competition

A product competes with the software if it replicates, substitutes, or closely resembles the software’s core functionality or value. This includes, but is not limited to, creating a product that provides similar functionality via any interface (such as services, libraries, or plug-ins), porting it to another platform or programming language, or providing it for free.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply any other licenses beyond those expressly stated here.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If your company makes such a claim, your patent license ends immediately for work on behalf of your company.

## Violations

The first time you are notified in writing that you have violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software not covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless continue if you come into full compliance with these terms, and take practical steps to correct past violations, within 32 days of receiving notice. Otherwise, all your licenses end immediately.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***

## Definitions

A **product** can be a good or service, or a combination of them.

**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.
